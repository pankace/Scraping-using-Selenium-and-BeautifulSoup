1,SAP legacy ERP customers still in no rush to adopt S/4HANA,3,1jgdjlq,SAP,https://www.reddit.com/r/SAP/comments/1jgdjlq/sap_legacy_erp_customers_still_in_no_rush_to/,8,"According to Gartner research, only about 39% of SAP's estimated 35,000 ECC customers have purchased licenses to transition to S/4HANA, launched back in 2015. The migration rate moving at a steady but slow pace.

For large businesses, ERP migrations typically take at least two years. Despite various marketing approaches from SAP over the years—focusing first on the technical advantages of the in-memory database, then on supply chain resilience during the pandemic, and now on AI capabilities with their Joule copilot—the migration trend hasn't significantly accelerated.

SAP is offering some alternatives for customers who can't migrate by the deadline. They've announced extended support until 2030 (for a 2% premium) and a new ""SAP ERP, Private Edition"" that would extend support until 2033 for customers who subscribe before 2028.

SAP's ""RISE with SAP"" program, which helps customers move to the cloud and migrate to S/4HANA, now accounts for 58% of total sales, up from 41% in Q2 2024. According to Gartner, some customers report feeling pressured into the RISE program, with SAP making it difficult to negotiate migration deals through other avenues.

Initially I was looking into the SAP Joule offering but was very disappointed when all they were providing for CAP development was a wrapper of the open-source extension ""continue"" with some questionable prompts for o1-mini.

Its not perfect, but I use it daily for my own work of developing CAP applications.
Sometimes I just need to write some SQL query which gets a couple of fields from different projections and all of the major frontier models usually fail on that task.  

IMO the strong features of CAP Pilot it are

* **Accuracy** due to advanced RAG with up to date documentation
* **References Documentation** You can just ask for ""source"" and will receive a working link to the right place in the Capire docs in many cases 
* **Data Privacy**, GDRP compliance with EU hosting (hetzner + Azure EU regional deployment)
* **Ease of use**: Just install it from the Extensions and enter you API key, VS Code, BAS, Anywhere.

If you are interested in trying out CAP Pilot, send me a dm. Or just [try it out](https://www.cap-pilot.de/chat) without signing up. Also I'm very happy to receive any feedback on my offering. I know Gen AI is a touchy subject, and probably most of you are tired of the AI posts. Nevertheless Im happy to provide some free API keys in exchange for some feedback.

We will have some new servers (AZURE VM) and the old system/server will be decommissioned.

Do you think I should:

\-SWPM -> SYSTEM COPY via (export/import) ? like any DB heteregenous copy.

\-SWPM -> SYSTEM COPY ""from backup option"" which is supposed to be used for Homogeneous syscopy?

3. Display the house bank from which the payment will be processed.
4. Work as a simulation, meaning no actual proposal or payment is created.

2. Consider AI tools usage in test automation work as well -  as per recent technology -  using plane English language statement we can automate the test case.   as per my knowledge  ,  writing manual test cases work will never be killed by AI ,as AI don't know about business.
3. AI usage in SAP functional work.
4. More specific in SAP functional is MM module as I am mechanical engineering background. and functional do not require programming - debugging is fine
5. instead of working in support, it is good to work as tester , am I right or wrong? as support work get paid less

Now let’s bring in Cloud identity services. Meaning I can do the similar oauth flow to get an access token & then since CIS trust is added to the sub account and then the role collection mapping is done to a group in CIS, this same token should be accepted by the backend(in turn XSUAA) right? Presently it is not happening! Am I missing any step?

Tier 1 ERPs like SAP and Oracle generally offer higher pay but come with a lot of repetitive work, and you don’t always get to see the full implementation process. On the other hand, Mid-Tier ERPs give you more hands-on experience across different aspects of implementation, making the work more engaging, but the pay is typically lower.

Hi Reddit,

We’re in the early planning stages of an idea and would love to gather some insights from the community. The concept involves creating a middleware web service that pulls data from Microsoft Dynamics F/o, parses an XML file (which contains hierarchical data and values), and then performs comparisons before sending the processed data back into our ERP system. 🔄

Our primary focus is on implementing this within Dynamics F/o, but we’re also curious about how similar integrations are handled in SAP ERP environments. Specifically, we’re interested in:

* **Data Extraction from Dynamics F/o:** What are the key considerations when pulling data from Dynamics F/o? Any pitfalls to watch out for? 🛠️
* **XML Parsing & Hierarchical Data Analysis:** What methods or tools do you recommend for efficiently parsing XML files, especially when dealing with complex hierarchical structures? 📄
* **ERP Data Integration:** What challenges have you encountered when transferring data back into an ERP system, and how did you overcome them? ⚙️
* **Middleware Design:** How should we best architect our middleware to handle data storage, processing, and routing effectively? 🧩
* **SAP ERP Comparison:** For those familiar with SAP ERP integrations, how are these processes typically handled, and what best practices or lessons learned can you share? 🤔

If you’ve worked on similar integrations or have any recommendations based on your experiences with either Dynamics or SAP ERP systems, we’d really appreciate your thoughts and advice. Looking forward to your feedback! 💡

Thanks in advance!",2025-02-28 13:47:40

Furthermore my customer has an detailed scheduling system, that plans orders. Thus the problem is, that the activities are planned in the detailed scheduling system but once the production order arrives at activity 3, it must be basically split, because only one part of the total amount of the materials for activity 3 is available and the other part will be available e. g. only a week later.

**--------------------------------**

I'm helping manage an SAP SuccessFactors environment which is integrated with several other solutions. One of the components in my environment is SAP Cloud Integration. I also have access to the BTP Cockpit.

I keep seeing mentions online of ""SAP Integration Suite"". These almost seem like two different products, but I actually see ""Cloud Integration"" as a the product in SAP for Me, and ""SAP Integration Suite"" as the solution area.

Is my understanding below accurate?

* SAP Cloud Integration (previously known as CPI)
   * Manage integrations
* SAP Integration Suite
   * Manage integrations, API management, workflow automations, etc.
* SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP)
   * Backbone that supports and enhances the functionality of SAP Cloud Integration and the Integration Suite
   * Brings together data management, analytics, AI, application development, and integration services, including Cloud Integration and the Integration Suite
* Cloud Integration > Integration Suite > BTP
   * This is the order for least features to most features
   * My org appears to have Cloud Integration and BTP but not Integration Suite
      * Checked in SAP for Me
* **Watched a video of Integration Suite and it appears to be the Cloud Integration Suite console with more options.**

246,Question on clearing process for debtors/creditors within SAP back end tables,2,1isohg2,SAP,https://www.reddit.com/r/SAP/comments/1isohg2/question_on_clearing_process_for_debtorscreditors/,6,"Hello,
 
I have a  question about the clearing process for AR in SAP
I’ll first write down what my current understanding is and then ask some follow up questions. 
Please could someone correct me if I've said something incorrect and help me get a better understanding of the process
Starting from the raising of an invoice my understanding is as follows:

1 - An invoice (INV1) gets raised, this invoice sits in VBRK / VBRP

2 - A journal (JNL1) gets posted to increase the debtor amount and the revenue amount 

3 - The link between JNL1 and INV1 is that the VBELN field in BSEG should match the VBELN field in the billing table 

4 - When cleared the AUGBL field in BSEG will be populated with the clearing document number (CLR1)

5 - The CLR1 reference will be populated in the AUGBL field of all accounting documents which it clears and against the relevant GL code - in the case of JNL1 it’ll be the AR line 
 
From here on I’m a bit lost 

A few questions which occur are:

1 - How do we then find the BELNR that posts the reduction in AR and increase in cash (or cash clearing account) ?

2 - If cash clearing,  how do we then find the actual cash posting ?

3 - Is it necessary for a an AUGBL to also be a BELNR? 

4 - If there are two invoices each 100CU and both a partially cleared by the same clearing document, and the amount cleared is 150CU, how can we determine that 75 was allocated to each versus 100 to one and 50 to the other or any other split?

5 - Is the logic process for creditors the same ?

6 - How are prepayments organised within the SAP system?

7 - Is there a difference between S4 and ECC6

Surprised myself with a big win on something I thought I could never do.

I happed to have the good fortune of working in a process industry where a company uses SAP S4 Hana. 

This company has multiple alternative BOMs in the system for both production and sales BOMs. Additionally they have BOM which are recursive, some with 24 levels and thousands of components. In this case I wanted to create a SQL query which would replicate the results of CS12 for all these BOMs. The purpose here was to do some heavy calculations regarding capacity of production equipment compared to the forecast for semifinished items. 



Now after a good bit of trouble over the Past few weeks I have actually written a query to extract all BOMs from the SAP system. One item I found had 8861 components across 24 levels and I got an exact match for all items in the Bom on all levels down to the raw components. This is for the 01 Bom version, an alternative 02 version and a non numerical alternative Bom listed as “TL” for the alternative Bom. 


I am really surprised by my results as I have always been told it is not possible to extract all multi level BOMs from an SAP system from the system tables in the database. You would be surprised that some tables are involved which do not normally relate to a BOM but are used in alternate BOM selection. 


Right now I am not to keen on sharing all the details but maybe someone could convince me. 

However my question is this. Do you believe this is impressive? Do you know anyone who has been able to do this? Should I be looking into consulting? I am beginning to feel I have very deep SAP knowledge…

Curious to know what you all think.

As for me it is a very good tool to force best practices but I can't undertand it from the commercial point of view. As you cannot modify almost anything (you can't even create and SD document type...), if you need to ""think out of the box"" you need side by side extendibility. Furthermore it lacks important features like a proper scheduling tool that cuts off most of the manufacturing and process companies. When you get grow, in these cases, you need also a good scheduler/MES. If you sum grow licensing and MES the cost is very close to rise with SAP. I understand the SAP commercials get higher fees if they sell grow instead of rise (and they get nothing for on premise), but this is getting wierd. I try to approch small-medium companies with grow, but there the license cost of Microsoft, Odoo or Pantera are a lot lower and you are out of the market. I can talk about AI, blockchain, security, cloud, wathever, but those small/medium companies simply don't care.

Furthermore as you go in grow you have a lot of hidden costs (like integration, CPEA, ecc.). System performances are also terrible. API are ""shared"" and your requests from exeternal systems go in queue with other requests. Do I miss something?",2025-02-10 18:18:41

In our SAP account as per our Basis team, it has been stated that password expiration is mandatory after 30/90 days. So due to this all our automation process gets stucked whenever password gets expired. So the question is, is there any way in SAP through which we can send notification to user on 28th or prior to 30th day, intimating that your password is going to expire after X days. So that before expiration day I change the password and process runs smoothly.

* Make Message Persistent
* Defer read Operation after POST 

Topic 1: I have no idea how to make this message persistent, there is no parameter in the Message Object for that

Topic 2: I have set Attribute refreshAfterChange already to false in manifest.json file in BAS, Errors are still not displayed

Another User did have a similar Problem [described here](https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-q-a/missing-ui-messages/qaq-p/12084586) and solved it by addressing Importing Parameter ""iv\_message\_target"" to '/#TRANSIENT#'.

I’m working on a **RAP-based application** in **SAP BTP Trial ABAP Environment** and need help figuring out how to handle multiple users for an approval flow. Here’s the setup:

# Application Overview

The app will have **three user personas:**

1. **Vendor** – Fills out a form with fields like **material** and **amount** and submits it.
2. **Manager (Approver)** – Reviews requests **if amount < 1000**.
3. **Senior Manager (Approver)** – Reviews requests **if amount >= 1000**.

# Planned Approach

* When a **vendor** submits the form, the data is stored in a table.
* Based on the **amount**, the approval request should be routed to either a **Manager** or a **Senior Manager**.
* I’m considering handling this approval process via **authorizations** (Instance-based or Global).

# The Challenge

Since the BTP Trial account allows **only one user**, I’m trying to figure out how to create multiple **business users** to test the flow with different user personas. I searched for solutions but couldn’t find a clear way to **simulate multiple users** in a trial setup.

# Questions

1. **Is there a way to create multiple users in BTP Trial?**
2. **If not, is there any workaround to test this approval process with different user roles?**",2025-02-07 00:26:12

I’m exploring some challenges related to SAP data and processes, and I’d love to get your thoughts.

Do you feel that your teams waste time and that your customers and suppliers lose trust due to issues with your information?

Would you agree that trying to address these problems without proper document controls can make your SAP transformation even more challenging, leading to:

* Document quality and consistency issues
* Extra effort to find the right documents
* Data privacy concerns
* Persistent errors in information
* Difficulty linking documents to business activities
* Incorrect information being shared with customers and suppliers

What’s been your experience? I'd love to hear your challenges.

But when the user clicks on the homepage button the WO gets locked and another user from Fiori cannot access the WO.

So can we have a customisation - when a user clicks on homepage button, the user should be prompted with the same message that when he uses the back button?

When a sales order is placed, it is expected to consume the nearest PIR from its RDD. In MD04, the VSF requirement will be replaced by CusOrd element. However, when the sales order is converted into a delivery note (no PGI yet), the VSF requirement re-appears wherein the quantity is similar to the delivery. This gives confusion between the planners and procurement as the ""unwanted"" VSF will generate new planned orders and requirements down to the raw materials after MRP run. The user claimed that when the delivery is processed with post goods issue, the ""unwanted"" VSF will disappear from the system.

I have tried to replicate this scenario in test environment but unfortunately I am getting the correct and expected scenario. We even raised this concern to SAP support but they cannot further investigate the issue. The problem is that this happens on random finished goods. We've checked the configurations given by the support according to some KB articles and they are all correct.

I wasn't really fired due to this fact as I was already on my notice period because I decided to leave this place around 2 months ago. (2 days ago was my last day).  

My insurance, I found out after the fact unfortunately, didn't have ""financial loss"" clausule coverd, so in theory I am not protected in case they decide to sue me for the income/financial lossess (though I highly doubt it had a significant impact, as their sales did not get really affected by it from what I know).

I am a full-stack SAP ERP developer lurking and commenting on this sub for some years already (this is a throwaway account).

I always thought about a tool that allows developers and architects a better insight into the custom developments of the SAP system they are currently working on and the feedback of you guys might help me assess this idea!

**The problem i see:** Every SAP (ERP) system has its long-term developers which basically know about 80% of the system. Whenever there is a new employee or a project with new external colleagues, we have a high on-boarding effort and in a lot of cases it is hard to get into the already existing developments - even before starting any new developments.

**The idea:** A tool, giving an overview of class structures, existing development objects, calls between them, the relevance of obects, currently open transports, and so on. In the long term i am hoping to be able to visualize which objects form one extension (from a technical perspective e.g. RAP model inclunding cds entities, behavior def and impl., binding, ...) and display some kind of map showing all customer extensions and maybe even the different processes they extend.

**What i build so far (aka my little MVP)**:

477,SAP Business one Scheduled Report Issue,1,1i2lh8n,SAP,https://www.reddit.com/r/SAP/comments/1i2lh8n/sap_business_one_scheduled_report_issue/,0,"Hi,

I have a query on SAP Business one that outputs the sales of Wi-Fi extenders, and I would like to create a scheduled report that is sent to users’ email addresses on the 1st day of each month. This report should reflect the sales from the previous month.

The query is as follows:

SELECT T0.DocDate, 

T0.CardName, 

T1.ItemCode, 

T1.Dscription, 

T1.Quantity 

FROM OINV T0  

INNER JOIN INV1 T1 ON T0.DocEntry = T1.DocEntry 

WHERE T1.ItemCode = 'VUL000008'

  AND T0.DocDate >= CAST(DATEADD(month, DATEDIFF(month, 0, GETDATE()) - 1, 0) AS DATE)

  AND T0.DocDate < CAST(DATEADD(month, DATEDIFF(month, 0, GETDATE()), 0) AS DATE)

The problem I’m encountering is that when the scheduled email is sent, it reports all sales data, not just the sales from the previous month, it is as if it is not recognising the date filters. I have tried multiple different codes and still the same things happens. 

However, the query works as expected when I run it manually in the Query Manager—only sales from December appear, as shown in the attached screenshot.

I have also included a screenshot of the scheduled report for reference.

Has anyone encountered this issue before or know how to resolve it? I would appreciate any assistance.

484,Dual Landscape Required for Support Pack Updates or Not,0,1i1hirx,SAP,https://www.reddit.com/r/SAP/comments/1i1hirx/dual_landscape_required_for_support_pack_updates/,4,"We are currently on ECC 6 Ehp 8, Support Pack 18.  We are in the process of planning to update to a later Support Pack version.  Our Basis team is suggesting we create a Dual Landscape for updating the support packs just like we did when we upgraded from Ehp7 to Ehp8. 

Dual landscape has 2 Development systems, 2 QA systems and 1 Production system. The DEV1/QA1 systems are updated with the latest support packs and another landscape (DEV2/QA2) keep the same support packs that are currently in Production.  Any maintenance needed in Production would start from the DEV2 system and transport up to a QA2 before going to Production and then the same change is made in DEV1 and transported to QA2.  

The idea of needing this is to not send a transport from an updated DEV1 system to a Production system on a lower support pack level.  Dual Landscape/Dual Maintenance is required when upgrading from one Enhancement Pack to a higher Enhancement Pack.

However, is a dual landscape environment really needed when we are just updating to a later support pack? We are not doing an Enhancement Pack upgrade.

I recently wrapped up a survey for my side project, [**erpboard.com**](http://erpboard.com). I surveyed 242 individuals, mostly from Reddit, with a few responses from LinkedIn. It’s not exactly the most professional report out there, but I promised to share the findings, so here’s a quick summary of the data and key insights.

To be honest, I kind of struggled to find the motivation to finish it. I'm not planning to continue working on the side project, as I don't have industry connections and the SAP market is a tight-knit community where it's tough to break in, especially as a nobody. Plus, building something like this without the right network is hard, and it looks like it’s more of a niche I’m not able to dive into. But hey, I committed to sharing the data for a response, I have to keep my word. So here it is!

**Summary of Findings:**

* **Top Roles & Experience:** SAP Consultants were the most common role (44.6%). Most people in the industry have 5+ years of experience and surprisingly 29 people doing pretty well for themselves without any higher education in SAP (that's cool imho).
* **Work Arrangements:** The majority (46.9%) work remotely, with 45.2% in hybrid setups. Europe is an even mix between hybrid and remote workers, while North America leans more fully remote. Didn't expect SAP to be so remote-focused I think that's great for people who love flexibility.
* **Compensation & Benefits:** Common benefits include health insurance (24.1%) and paid time off (22.1%). Salary-wise, most professionals fall between $50,000–$150,000, with a few at the higher end (above $250,000).
* **Growth Areas:** SAP S/4HANA and Cloud Solutions are big growth areas, with AI/ML also gaining traction.
* **Challenges:** Keeping up with new tech (13.4%) and skill gaps (7.8%) are the biggest pain points for professionals.

**What You Can Do:**

* You can view all the data, including different splits and more detailed insights, in the Google Sheet I’ve linked here. Feel free to copy the sheet into your drive and play around with the data—pivot, cut, or analyze it as you like, it's yours to explore! 😊

**Link to the full data and report**: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VOzFt7bVRGy5q3O2VNbyGkIh6mSWDTM9tzba12bBChs/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VOzFt7bVRGy5q3O2VNbyGkIh6mSWDTM9tzba12bBChs/edit?usp=sharing)

I know it’s not the most polished report (I didn't have much motivation to finish it), but I hope this is still useful for anyone looking for insights into the SAP.

I'm working on a project where I must update information on SF (background: I initially fetch from 4 different OData receivers and enhance the previous ones.

- 1. Info is inconsistent in some cases: I'm using a loop to fetch information through different positions and looping through managers, but sometimes I get a different employee who is not in the position ladder (it usually switched between either the correct manager or a second person, let's say that it goes between manager and Bob, instead of switching between manager and random person)

- 2. I can't update more than 3k at a time while using a splitter and upsert method.

- 3. There are some entries that I can't access at all, so I don't know if it could be something to do with authorization or that there are missing mandatory fields or if those entries have an error... I can fetch their information, but not update it.

Edit: I forgot to add, I have tried with <15 entries at once (even specifically those that had errors within 5 consecutive executions), and the manager information comes out correctly, so it only happens when there are many employees.",2025-01-14 22:52:07

So, the story was as follows - I created a new step in a substitution ABC, 23rd step to be exact. A developer prepared a user exit for it. 

Once we tested it and everything went fine I released the transport to the test system and we were waiting for our release manager to put it onto production a week later. 

Once the substitution got imported to production, it turned out that it contained new steps which were not there when I created my original transport - for the tables GB91* there were only objects that I expected to be there, however, for some reason, it passed on entire contents of the GB92* tables, containing the entries created AFTER the transport request was made. And those additional steps were referencing another user exit which was not loaded onto production.

The result? Red error whenever anyone tried to post a document. 

Fortunately, we fixed it quickly at today's morning by removing those new steps from dev system and reloading the transports.


Conclusion? Import all new changes to a given substitution all at once, do not stretch them in time ;p",2025-01-14 16:27:56

I was put in Ariba support as a fresher (no IT background, did civil engineering B.Tech) with just a 40 min KT session and was asked to learn by starting to take on tickets. For the first 20 days or so I had the guy previously working in support (he's an expert) help me in a 20 min call on how to go about the ticket at hand and that's it. By the time I solved like 10-12 tickets or so but didn't learn anything. Just the navigation to where some things are in Ariba.

And then I was flooded with tickets that I knew nothing about but had to solve. The expert guy would only answer my chat only if he feels that I checked for docs and tried something in test environment. So I did that and heavily relied on him for identifying the issue and strategising a solution. I didn't have the luxury of time to learn how he figured out what was causing the issue or how he knew what could fix it. I only operated on his analysis and strategy. I confronted the delivery manager and he hired a new guy. He has experience but doesn't know sh*t to the point I had to step in to fix his mistakes. He's so egoistical that he doesn't even take any suggestions from me. So learning from him won't workout.

Fast forward one year I've resolved 300+ tickets but feel like I know nothing about Ariba. I still don't know how a lot of the system works especially in the supplier side. Like I don't know how to use Ariba for something, only know to change few things here and there.

I currently work with SAP BPC, GR, and SAC, and I’ve noticed that these tools don’t seem to have the same momentum in the market as they once did, at least here in Mexico.

BPC: It feels like it’s being replaced by other planning solutions.

GR: There seem to be fewer new projects involving it.

SAC: While it has potential, it doesn’t seem to be gaining traction in this region as much as expected.

I’d love to hear your thoughts on:

1. The current relevance of these tools: Are they still in demand in your projects? Are you seeing opportunities for them, especially in Mexico or Latin America?

2. AI opportunities in the SAP ecosystem:

What SAP tools or technologies would you recommend exploring to integrate Artificial Intelligence into my skillset?

Are there any success stories of AI being integrated with SAC or BTP?

I’m considering learning more about AI, but I also want to stay aligned with the SAP ecosystem. Do you think it’s worth delving into SAP-related AI, or should I explore external tools (like Python, Power BI, etc.) that could integrate with SAP?

I truly appreciate any advice or insights you can share. 😊",2025-01-11 02:03:23

We noticed that printing messages that use SAPSCRIPT forms takes a very long time when we are logged in our language (PT) and is very fast when we login with English (EN)

I contacted our support and the abapper told to migrate from sapscript to smartforms.

I would really like to know the cause of this and if possible fix it, before migrating to smartforms without really knowing the impact.

Did anyone came across this? Is there a solution?

I implemented a workflow for BUS2009 ( purchase requisition by item) and I am sending within the task an email with item data and approval/rejection link.  BUS2009 is at item level, this WF sending an email by position. 

The client has required to group in a single email all items that share the same release code ( and then, same approvers) to avoid approvers to receive lost os single emails and receive one email with all items to be approved by them.

I tried to recover at execution WI related to combination of BUS , PR and Item from SWW\_WI2OBJ.... but at runtime of WF execution is still not persisted there.

So I think on save WI-PR-Item-Releasecode data in an auxiliary table and when is in the last position, recovery the info, group by release code and send email, but WI are raised in parallel, not in sequence... so information could not be completed when I am in ""the last"" position, and can cause concurrence issues if several items try to save in the custom table at the time.

As debugger is the most important tool for a developer i'm not sure if i don't know where to find the options i want or if it don't really exist.

Maybe someone with more expertise in ADT tools can help me find what i need or can confirm that the debugger is awful.

Some of the options i miss are:

\- Memory analysis tool with dominator tree.

\- Something similar to debugger options in SAPGUI where you can find options as useful as:

* System Debugging
* Cross-Roll-Area Stack Active
* Check sorting before READ BINARY CHECK

\- The panel that allows to activate/deactivate SE30(or SAT)/ST05 traces to confortably get traces of chunks of code.

\- Something like the SAPGUI toolbar Step Size button that allows to debug complex conditions step by step to find exactly which part of condition is not meet.

\- Something like Breakpoint at statement menu.

\- Something like the Diff tab to compare variables.

\- Options to manually COMMIT/ROLLBACK or run garbage collector.

\- Option to jump to a line of code without executing anything.

\- Since SAP considers some things as obsolete, I guess there is no tool like Dynpro Analysis, which is very useful when a screen does not look like you expect, and with the amount of things missing I imagine that the Script tab of the debugger that allowed doing more advanced things does not exist either, but let me know if i'm wrong.

I'm pretty new to SAP and trying to learn.

When performing goods issues for production process orders in MIGO, individual components have different fields that need to be filled out. Out of which ""Batch"" is the field that I'm interested in. 

So, when I select a SLOC (storage location) for any respective component, under Batch when I open the pop up to select Batch number it shows me batches of all SLOC's. Can I filter Batch by SLOC so that when I'm in MIGO, as soon as I enter SLOC, the batch associated with the storage location is filtered under batch column popup menu?

I've recently started at a new company, and our team has experienced a significant loss of knowledge due to recent departures. I'm currently working on year-end activities in SAP but lack sufficient background information, making me cautious as I obviously prefer to understand the tasks I'm performing.

One of the instructions involves setting up new number ranges for documents for the upcoming year. Our Finance department uses transaction FBN1 directly in the production environment to establish these number ranges. I understand that maintaining these number ranges is a common practice.

After Finance sets up the new number ranges for various document types and company codes, IT then follows additional steps in FBN1 to create a transport for these number ranges in production. Essentially, this process involves creating a new transport request and releasing it.

Here are the steps outlined:

FBN1 - no selection on the initial screen  
Interval > Transport  
Create a new transport request in production  
Release this transport via SE01 in production

I'm unclear about the necessity of creating a transport request in this case within the production environment. Does anyone understand the reason behind this? Is it necessary to 'activate' the newly added number ranges, or could it be a precautionary measure to use this transport request in case of an issue?",2024-12-26 03:47:14

I hope this community can help solve an issue we have when doing quota arrangement with vendors having different leadtimes. 

We have quota arrangement on several part numbers where we have a local supplier with 7 days lead time and then an oversea suppliers with 100 days leadtime. 

 When our increases and we actually need to order more parts then the new purchasing requisition is being placed after the last confirmed PO even if we only have 7 days leadtime. This means that we manually need to pull in the purchasing requesition (and spot it) in stead of SAP utilizes the short lead time vendor to close the gap. 

Have we set up the qouta arrangement wrong and can we do something different to avoid this manual work and confusion?

SAP is now generating revenue with cloud the cloud business, meaning SAP S/4HANA and Ariba, success factors and probably IBP, if you trust this subreddit..

As a Consultant with 10ye I fear, im going to be left behind. My organization mainly works in SAP implementation projects nowadays. Lots of them are on premise. The skill set of our team consists mostly of these on premise skills as well. Sales talks ""we can do everything!"", colleagues talk this etc. I myself and we can do customizing, ABAP, forms, you name it. Modulewise, its the whole package, from Finance and controlling, order to cash, purchasing, ewm, tm, pp, abap and integration

If you follow SAP, Grow and Rise and the lot, you, as a consultant, have need the customer to change from ""thats my requirement"" to ""how can i adapt this solution"" - I fear, i am not learning this soft skill, nor the necessary hard skills in the cloud world. 

Our management still wants to harvest the sweet sweet on premise installbase.

We are a company that manufactures chemical products, and we are exploring SAP Business One as a potential ERP solution. Our company has around 100 employees, with approximately 20 expected to actively use the system.

One challenge we face in our current system is handling errors efficiently, such as:

* Incorrect data entry for material usage or stock levels during production.
* Errors in goods receipts or supplier orders, like incorrect pricing or wrong item codes.

These issues are currently difficult to correct, often leading to significant disruptions. We want to ensure that SAP Business One would allow authorized users to fix such errors easily without causing additional system problems.

Could anyone share their experiences with error handling in SAP Business One? Is it user-friendly in such scenarios? Additionally, do you think it is a good fit for a company of our size in the chemical manufacturing industry?

I’ve heard claims that some companies had to complement SAP Business One with additional ERP solutions. Is this true, or just a misunderstanding?

We recently upgraded our SAP system to the latest version, retaining all master data and customizations as they were before. However, I’m encountering an issue with detailed scheduling for planned orders during MRP runs:

* **Issue:** When MRP creates a planned order, the capacity requirements are not scheduled, and the **Detailed Scheduling** tab is missing in the planned order. Specifically:
   * Entries in **KBKO** and **KBED** tables (capacity requirements) are not created.
   * The **BEDID** (Capacity Requirement ID) is not passed to the **PLAF** table.
   * However, if I manually open the planned order and click the **Scheduling** button:
      * Capacity requirements are scheduled.
      * Entries in **KBKO** and **KBED** are created.
      * The **BEDID** is updated in the **PLAF** table.
* **Additional Context:**
   1. This issue only occurs in the updated system; it was working fine before the upgrade where capacity was scheduled, and the entries were created in the tables. 
   2. It still works correctly in our **Quality system**, which is on the previous SAP version.
   3. I have tested MRP via **MD01N** and **SAP APO Product View**, but detailed scheduling is not triggered in either case.
* **Troubleshooting Attempts:**
   * Debugged **PPH\_MRP\_START**, but couldn’t find the root cause.
   * Verified that all customizing and master data are unchanged from the previous version.
* Could you help me understand:
   * Which program, function module, or method generates the capacity requirements entries in **KBKO** and **KBED** during MRP run?
   * How can I debug this process further to identify what’s not being triggered after the upgrade?

Any insights or suggestions to debug the issue backward would be greatly appreciated!",2024-11-25 13:58:04

The data is taken from various sources, including financial information from various 3rd parties who work on the project. Whilst the client uses SAP, a lot of the 3rd parties do not. Instead they use a mix of excel files and other ERP systems and all the data is entered in different templates and formats. This results in complexity and the finance report can take a long time to collate.   
  
As such, they'd like to standardise how data is inputted and received, to make the process simpler and faster.

We are looking to archive data to SAP, that was present in Oracle Hyperion application.

In the oracle hyperion application, we have data saved to oracle server in a different format. To transfer data to other systems they are saving the data in the normal format into database tables.

In reports on oracle application, they using the base data in the tables and doing calculations on the go using some oracle code and displaying it. Data that is being displayed for many of these fields is based on calculations and will not be saved in database.

Now while archiving data to SAP, they wanted to know if they can archive the data, that is present in the reports that they were seeing which are based on oracle formulas.

Do we have any option for this functionality? 

Also what the best way to transfer data from Oracle Hyperion to SAP. We are looking to archive data, which is currently 8TB in the oracle end.

As far as my understanding. I see we can't easily do data transfer for the fields which are displayed in the oracle reports if isn't not saved in oracle DB.

I see following options:  
1. Push base data to SAP and do reporting similar to oracle in SAP to get the required data,  
2. Save the report data in oracle application to a new table and push it to SAP along with base data while archiving.

They explained that SAP has set a 2030 deadline for all customers to migrate to SAP Rise—or else they’ll be decommissioned. They also mentioned that, as a result, most companies would only need one or two BASIS consultants going forward, since SAP Rise would handle nearly all traditional BASIS activities.
